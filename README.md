## Who is this For, What are the Caveats
A California resident built this with <a HREF="https://gemini.google.com" target="_blank">Google gemini AI assistance</A> because he is in retirement and has an unhealthy IRA balance to manage. 
The purpose of this tool, therefore, is to model as accurately as possible the remaining years of life with respect to spendable cash and taxation - and to determine how to optimize spendable cash. This tool may be useful to you are in or very near retirement.  
Signficantly more analysis is needed to do pre-retirement optimization.
		
Many focus on <i>Roth Conversions</i> and that's not wrong thinking, but such a view misses the big picture of WHY to do conversions. Also from the time one stops getting regular W2 income until the time one starts receiving pensions or social security is known as the "valley of opportunity".  
During this otherwise low income period, strategic withdrawals and movement is possible. Ultimately you are in a better place if you have <i>degrees of freedom</i> in your assets - more on this in a moment. 
It also does not make sense to pay more tax than necessary. I do not see taxation as evil, but it does not feel "right" to pay up to 14,000/year in IRMAA fees for no net benefit 
in Medicare - but that is one of the many pitfalls of having too much forced income.
		
Having a large tax deferred balance has many consequences, the worst being taking forced income (RMDs) at higher tax rates and incurring IRMAA penalties - as just described - as well.  
In this tool, we lump IRMAA together with California state and Federal taxes (including NIIT and capital gains) to show the big picture: net taxes/net spendable income.

#### So here are the key things you'll find:

1. A complete model until death of a single person or married couple with RMDs calculated, separation of 5 different accounts (IRA1, IRA2, Brokerage, Cash, ROTH)
2. Tweakable rates, withdrawal strategies, and charts and tables to match them - but NOT TOO many variables.
3. A structure that can allow replacement of the California tax tables with (any) other states. 33 of the US states tax IRA and 401K withdrawals the same way - albeit at different tax rates.  Also, those same 33 states treat all capital gains as taxable income - and that can matter quite a lot.
4. Modeling can show the true cost of the widow penalty (when one spouse predeceases another)
5. The ability to model different spending rates in retirement (e.g. the spending SMILE)
6. A simple way to see the MOST you might expect to spend through retirement, what happens if your life expectancy is changed
7. It automatically rolls any IRA balance from the decease spouse to the living spouse (because RMDs may apply differently!)

#### In the works are some additonal features:

1. More/improved graphs.
2. Better organized tables.
3. Forecasting the affect of the impending 2033 Social Security Fund depletion (with a 33% reduction in payouts)
4. Tweak the tax rates with separate federal and state creep.  The 

#### What it completely ignores:

1. The various short term benefits to seniors under the OBB (e.g. extra deductions and phaseouts).
2. Any state other than California (at the moment).
3. Forecasting variable growth rates, or growth rates that differ between different assets.  (It's silly to forecast 8% growth in an IRA and 4% growth in a ROTH - or v.v.)
4. Trying to Monte-Carlo or apply historical models.
5. This is not a tool to attempt to model different asset class ratios, or different asset location arrangements.
6. Tax filing statuses other than MFJ (married filing jointly) and SGL (Single). There is no Head of Household, Married filing separately, etc.
