# Test harnesses

Investigative / audit scripts for the retirement optimizer engine. These are **not** part of the
regular unit-test suite (`optimizer_core.test.js`); they are kept here so a finding can be
re-derived on demand. Two kinds:

| harness | runs in | what it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `betr_harness.js` | **node** | Is the Break-Even Tax Rate (BETR) signal trustworthy? |
| `stopyear_harness.js` | **browser console** | When should a plan stop Roth conversions? |

## betr_harness.js  (node)

```bash
node .test_harnesses/betr_harness.js
```

Self-contained: stubs the DOM globals and `require()`s `taxengine.js` + `optimizer_core.js` the
same way `optimizer_core.test.js` does. Compares, for several legacy scenarios, the tool's shown
BETR (`totals.betrAvg`) against (a) the Kitces closed form recomputed at years-to-RMD vs the full
horizon, and (b) the **empirical** break-even heirs rate `t*` derived from two full simulations
(convert vs a plain no-conversion run). Also prints the concrete after-tax gain from converting at
several heirs rates so the verdict needs no interpretation.

**Finding (2026-07-23):** the closed-form BETR is algebraically correct but, as used, materially
overstates the rate needed to justify converting. The years-to-RMD horizon is a minor contributor
(~1-2 pts); the dominant gap is that the closed form ignores the RMD/IRMAA/SS/bracket second-order
taxes the full simulation captures. See the audit notes in the header comment and the on-screen
caveats (the cash-drag amplifier / audit Q2).

## stopyear_harness.js  (browser console)

Paste into the retirement optimizer's browser console after loading a scenario (it depends on the
page's `getInputs()` / `simulate()` / `afterTaxNetWorth`). Re-runs the plan at every conversion
cutoff and scores each on after-tax net worth to find the best year to stop converting. This is the
research harness behind Phase P24; the production version of the search now lives in
`optimizer_core.js` as `bestConversionStopYear()`.

```js
// in the page console:
EV2.reportStopYear();        // per-cutoff table for the current sidebar scenario
EV2.reportPolicies();        // best amount vs best stop-year vs joint
```
